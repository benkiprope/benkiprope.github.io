<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I am a recent college graduate trying to find my way around the world, mostly by looking for work, while trying to create original content every so often. I intend to write at least one article on a researched choice topic once every month, and to publish some data insights/visualizations once every two months.</p>
<p>In college I majored in economics and mathematics. My primary areas of interest are financial services; industrial research; regulatory economics; education policy; and macroeconomic modeling and policy. I also am a novice programmer and still learning to play badminton â€“ 3 years in; yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I will be using this repository to learn web coding, especially JavaScript. Also, I hope to post most of data analytics findings here from R scripting/mining/analysis and D3 'beautification</p>
